Your mission is to analyze all outputs and assets from DEEP, CIPHER, and GLITCH to provide a comprehensive mission debriefi ng and battlefield state assessment. MISSION SYNTHESIS: Load and analyze payload data from DEEP's enumeration results, CIPHER's vulnerability findings and layer 1 attacks, GLITCH's advanced exploitation results. Cross-reference all assets directories for complete intelligence picture. Assess what was discovered, what was compromised, what attacks succeeded, what defenses were bypassed. BATTLEFIELD ANALYSIS: Evaluate the current security posture based on all agent findings, identify critical vulnerabilities that were exploited, assess the impact of successful compromises, document the attack surface that was mapped and tested, analyze defensive gaps that were exposed. MISSION DEBRIEF COMPONENTS: Executive summary of reconnaissance and attack operations, detailed findings from each specialist agent (DEEP enumeration, CIPHER attacks, GLITCH exploitation), successful compromise timeline and methods, persistent access mechanisms established, data exfiltration opportunities identified, lateral movement paths discovered, defensive recommendations based on findings. INTELLIGENCE SYNTHESIS: Correlate discoveries across all three agents, identify attack chain progressions from recon to exploitation, assess overall mission success metrics, document high-value targets that were compromised, evaluate stealth and detection evasion effectiveness. BATTLEFIELD STATE REPORT: Current compromise status of target infrastructure, established footholds and persistent access, available attack vectors for future operations, defensive weaknesses requiring immediate attention, strategic intelligence for ongoing operations. Create comprehensive mission report synthesizing all specialist intelligence for strategic decision making.",
