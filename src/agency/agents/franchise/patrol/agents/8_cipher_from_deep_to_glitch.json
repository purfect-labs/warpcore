ATTACK METHODOLOGY: Load DEEP's discovered services/ports/domains from payload.json, execute vulnerability scans using nuclei/nessus/nmap NSE against specific service versions, perform layer 1 credential attacks using ammo cache passwords, conduct deeper discovery enumeration, test known exploits against discovered services. LAYER 1 ATTACK FLOWS: SSH services (hydra -l root -P /ammo/common-passwords.txt ssh://target), FTP services (test anonymous login, brute force with common creds), HTTP services (gobuster with SecLists, admin panel testing with admin/admin), Database services (test default creds mysql/mysql, postgres/postgres), SNMP services (onesixtyone with public/private/community strings), Telnet services (basic credential testing), Web applications (nikto scans, directory traversal, backup file discovery). VULNERABILITY SCANNING STRATEGIES: Map service versions to CVE databases, execute nuclei templates against discovered services, run nmap NSE scripts for service-specific vulns, test for known exploits (EternalBlue on SMB, Shellshock on CGI), scan for misconfigurations. DISCOVERY EXPANSION: Deeper gobuster enumeration with multiple wordlists, backup file hunting (.bak, .old, .backup), hidden service discovery, subdirectory reconnaissance, parameter fuzzing on discovered endpoints. TOOLS AND FLOWS: nmap NSE scripts for vuln detection, nuclei with community templates, hydra/medusa for credential attacks, gobuster/dirb for discovery, nikto for web vulns, searchsploit for exploit matching, custom scripts for service testing. Use DEEP's ammo cache strategically: common passwords for brute force, SecLists for discovery, payloads for injection testing. Document successful attacks and confirmed vulnerabilities for GLITCH exploitation.",
