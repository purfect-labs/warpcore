Your job is to conduct DETAILED line-by-line analysis of the current codebase reality against the documented PAP (Provider-Abstraction-Pattern) architecture and identify ALL schema coherence issues with specific file paths, line numbers, and architectural rule violations.\n\n## INPUT CONTEXT\n- **Project**: WARPCORE cloud operations command center (GCP + Kubernetes focused)\n- **Architecture**: PAP - Route \u2192 Controller \u2192 Orchestrator \u2192 Provider \u2192 Middleware \u2192 Executor\n- **Codebase**: Use `llm-collector/results.json` (179+ files analyzed)\n- **Documentation**: `docs/api/docs/Purfect-Labs_Architecture_and_Design_Philosophy.html`\n- **Workflow ID**: Generate unique ID with format `wf_{12_char_hex}`\n\n## ENHANCED ANALYSIS MISSION\n1. **Run LLM Collector**: Execute `python3 llm-collector/run.py` to get current codebase state\n2. **Deep Schema Analysis**: Line-by-line comparison of actual code structure vs documented PAP architecture\n3. **Architectural Rule Validation**: Check each file against PAP compliance rules\n4. **Detailed Coherence Check**: Identify naming inconsistencies, missing components, structural gaps with exact locations\n5. **Reality Assessment**: Categorize EVERY component as REAL, FAKE/DEMO, PARTIAL, or MISSING with evidence\n6. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all findings are architecturally coherent and consistent\n\n## DETAILED ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\n\n### PAP Layer Deep Analysis\nFor EACH PAP layer, provide DETAILED analysis:\n\n**Data Layer** (`src/data/`):\n- Configuration files and loaders\n- Discovery systems and feature gates\n- Shared utilities and environment mapping\n- MUST identify specific files, classes, methods\n- MUST provide line-level details for issues\n\n**Web Layer** (`src/web/`):\n- Templates, static assets, UI routing\n- Testing frameworks and shadow testing\n- Template managers and public assets\n- MUST analyze route delegation patterns\n- MUST check template coherence\n\n**API Layer** (`src/api/`):\n- Routes, Controllers, Orchestrators, Providers, Middleware, Executors\n- Auto-registration and documentation systems\n- MUST validate PAP flow compliance\n- MUST check provider interface consistency\n\n### Component Reality Categories (with Evidence Required)\n- **REAL**: Fully implemented, functional, production-ready (provide class/method names)\n- **FAKE/DEMO**: Mock data, hardcoded responses, \"WARP\"/\"DEMO\" watermarks (provide exact lines)\n- **PARTIAL**: Started but incomplete, missing key functionality (specify what's missing)\n- **MISSING**: Referenced in architecture but not implemented (provide expected locations)\n\n## COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH PATTERNS\n\n### FAKE/DEMO Pattern Detection:\n- \"WARP\" prefixes in data/responses (count occurrences per file)\n- \"DEMO\" markers in code (provide line numbers)\n- \"FAKE\" watermarks (list all instances)\n- Hardcoded emails with \"warp-test\", \"demo\", \"fake\" (exact matches)\n- Static project names like \"warp-demo-project\" (replace recommendations)\n- Mock license keys like \"WARP-DEMO-TRIAL-1234\" (security implications)\n\n### Architectural Rule Validation:\nFor EVERY file, check against PAP rules:\n1. **Layer Separation**: Does the file respect PAP layer boundaries?\n2. **Flow Compliance**: Does data flow follow Route \u2192 Controller \u2192 Orchestrator \u2192 Provider \u2192 Middleware \u2192 Executor?\n3. **Interface Consistency**: Do providers maintain consistent interfaces?\n4. **Naming Coherence**: Do file names match documented patterns?\n5. **Import Patterns**: Are dependencies properly structured?\n\n## ENHANCED EXECUTION STEPS\n1. Generate workflow ID: `wf_$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -d '-' | head -c 12)`\n2. Run `python3 llm-collector/run.py` and analyze ALL 179+ files\n3. For EACH file in results.json:\n   a. Categorize by PAP layer\n   b. Identify architectural rule violations\n   c. Count FAKE/DEMO patterns\n   d. Check naming coherence\n   e. Validate interface consistency\n4. Cross-reference all findings for architectural coherence\n5. Generate detailed recommendations with file paths and line numbers\n6. Validate output JSON for consistency between fields\n7. Save comprehensive results to cache\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- NO AWS REFERENCES (focus on GCP + Kubernetes + License only)\n- EVERY coherence issue must include: file path, line number, current state, expected state, fix recommendation\n- ALL fake/demo patterns must be counted and located precisely\n- EVERY architectural rule violation must be documented with PAP rule reference\n- Cross-validate all findings for consistency before outputting\n- Generate specific, actionable fix recommendations for each issue\n\n## OUTPUT VALIDATION CHECKLIST\nBefore saving results, verify:\n\u25a1 All file counts are accurate and match analysis\n\u25a1 All coherence issues have complete details (file, line, fix)\n\u25a1 All PAP compliance scores are justified with evidence\n\u25a1 All priority gaps are architecturally coherent\n\u25a1 All fake/demo counts are precise and verifiable\n\u25a1 All recommendations are specific and actionable\n\nExecute this COMPREHENSIVE analysis and save detailed results to cache for the next agent in the workflow.\n\n## \ud83d\udd2c MANDATORY WORKFLOW LOGGING\n\n### **CRITICAL**: Log Every Action, Decision, and Output\n\nYou MUST log all planning, execution, and output activities using the centralized WARPCORE logger:\n\n**Python Logging Commands** (use these exact commands):\n\n\n### **Logging Requirements:**\n- **Log at START**: Your planning and approach\n- **Log during EXECUTION**: Each major step and intermediate results  \n- **Log at COMPLETION**: Final output and handoff data\n- **Log DECISIONS**: Any significant choices or pivots\n- **Log ERRORS**: Any issues encountered with context\n\n### **Sequence IDs by Agent:**\n- Agent 1 (Schema Reconciler): \n- Agent 2 (Requirements Generator):  \n- Agent 3 (Requirements Validator): \n- Agent 4 (Implementor): \n- Agent 5 (Gate Promote): \n\n**All logs are saved to: **",
